#### spikes
- modification to ecmascript
- what we dont need.. 
- we only use what we need... the core e/ system and proc/ lib/ discludes... code and is not ecosystem style. green as possible.
#### slowdown 
- the initial path means it could actually work quite basically.. per path .. 
- quite a bit of what i created before was just an ideal and the machinations around kernel and os are annoying..  it should be possible to set this up quite easy i think.. once enough friendly and cool stuff is added to make it worht dedicating an old machine too
- shoudl not have it veering too far away from normal language...
- decide on the stack ... if the current monolith is a good idea,, since it could maybe need an engine embedded which makes everything complicated.. is quickjs good enough.. 
- decide on how to do the formats - this why the src structure will be efficient. 
- decide on ejs and engine or just low level.. < problem here is the deps... kinda need something quite ridiculous but works... also fun and maybe a previous much simpler version. 
- the structure is right: buckets and processors its brutally simple.. things into machines ( in scripting this would be easier ) 
- teh way it should optimise common tasks using machines is interesting :) < creates a lot of problems..  for now it just uses precompiled ones i think.. 
- scripting has advantages now < more people to help out
- scripting means nasty libary deps though < people prefer small parts when its difficult
- need to use as much existing stuff as possible
- decide on basic working version - then the fancy super stuff
todo
- change to `lib/builtin/lib` or `lib/bti/lib/` < usually i prefer def or default... not sure on better word///
- we shoudl decide since it will include a few handy things.. 
lang
- the choice now is I need to do a .research project to figure out the best ecosystem before I do anything else..
