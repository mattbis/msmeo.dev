#### slowdown 
- quite a bit of what i created before was just an ideal and the machinations around kernel and os are annoying.. 
- shoudl not have it veering too far away from normal language...
- decide on the stack ... if the current monolith is a good idea,, since it could maybe need an engine embedded which makes everything complicated..
