#### slowdown 
- quite a bit of what i created before was just an ideal and the machinations around kernel and os are annoying.. 
- shoudl not have it veering too far away from normal language...
- decide on the stack ... if the current monolith is a good idea,, since it could maybe need an engine embedded which makes everything complicated.. 
- decide on how to do the formats - this why the src structure will be efficient. 
- decide on ejs and engine or just low level.. < problem here is the deps... kinda need something quite ridiculous but works... 
- the structure is right: buckets and processors its brutally simple..
