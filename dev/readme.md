#### slowdown 
- quite a bit of what i created before was just an ideal and the machinations around kernel and os are annoying.. 
- shoudl not have it veering too far away from normal language...
- decide on the stack ... if the current monolith is a good idea,, since it could maybe need an engine embedded which makes everything complicated.. 
- decide on how to do the formats - this why the src structure will be efficient. 
- decide on ejs and engine or just low level.. < problem here is the deps... kinda need something quite ridiculous but works... 
- the structure is right: buckets and processors its brutally simple.. things into machines ( in scripting this would be easier ) 
- teh way it should optimise common tasks using machines is interesting :) < creates a lot of problems..  for now it just uses precompiled ones i think.. 
- scripting has advantages now < more people to help out
- scripting means nasty libary deps though < people prefer small parts when its difficult
- need to use as much existing stuff as possible
- decide on basic working version - then the fancy super stuff
todo
- change to `lib/builtin/lib`
