# this is part of how the clone/cloneNee works bulb->cherry
### the tool generates a massive amount of operations... you use the fq bti logger for kernel or transaction/contracts key points... the slow loger is like an emergency logger in the bulb.. 
- since the bulb is the copy the does the actual work... 
- using the op_modes or pre compiled versions means all this is configurable
- using a configurable binary means you can live edit everything...
