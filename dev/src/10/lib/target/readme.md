what in the world is this?
- i think its probably something like given the argset - it resolves - the baked profile to the target .. whatever it is
- this is why user is before it so we know what we actually output - its like a manifest stage
- so if you had a different kind of build you can exclude certain parts etc .. ( maybe I have to really remember what I was thinking or check the old one )
